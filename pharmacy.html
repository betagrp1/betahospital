      <h3>Our Services</h3><hr>
      <p><b>QUALITY MEDICINES BY PROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL</b>

Manned by highly qualified professional staff with specialized certifications, The Beta Hospital pharmacy prides in the quality of professional services offered to clients.

The pharmacy is committed to providing efficient services to both in-patients and out-patients, whilst ensuring that treatment is safe and appropriate. We dispense quality medicines at all our pharmacy outlets at the best price possible. Before stocking, medicines undergo a vetting and approval process by an in- house committee, The Medicines and Therapeutic Committee; a body that plays a vital governance, policy and support role for medicine use processes within the Hospital. The Hospital procures all medicines and medical supplies only from registered suppliers thereby guaranteeing our patients quality medicines at all times, especially in light of the risk of counterfeit and substandard products in the industry.</p>

<p><b>OUT-PATIENT PHARMACY SERVICES</b>

The pharmacy department has seven outpatient pharmacy outlets; four at the Main Hospital and three at our Out-patient Centres at Gigiri, Warwick Centre and Galleria Mall; each headed by a Senior Pharmacist. At The Beta Hospital Pharmacy, patients and clients are assured of reliable late night pharmacy services at all our pharmacy outlets and 24 hour outpatient pharmacy services at the Main Hospital in a secure ambient environment.</p>

<p><b>BOTH LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL PRESCRIPTIONS</b>

We dispense medicines on valid prescriptions; both for patients seen within the Hospital and also for patients seen by doctors outside the Hospital. Patient with prescriptions written by doctors from outside Kenya may have their prescriptions rewritten by our casualty doctors and consultants and dispensed in any of our outpatient pharmacy outlets.</p>


<p><b>100% PRESCRIPTION FILL</b>

The Nairobi Hospital prides in our commitment to offer a 100% prescription fill for our clients. The Hospital continuously relooks at her processes to ensure that they deliver all prescribed medicines. Moreover, the institution in close consultation with the Pharmacy & Poisons Board imports specialized and essential drugs that are not locally available for critical care and specific disease conditions.

</p>

<p><b>COMPETITIVE PRICES</b>

The Beta Hospital offers very competitive prices for our medicines due to the volume discounts and bonuses we negotiate with our suppliers, which is then passed on to the patients.</p>
